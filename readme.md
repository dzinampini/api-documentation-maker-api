### Common Issue 1 - Missing Token Files 
1. Download the tokenizer files from base model (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased):
Drag these files from ./temp_tokenizer/:
tokenizer_config.json
vocab.txt
special_tokens_map.json
tokenizer.json 

2. Upload files manually to your Hugging Face repo:

Go to model repository on Hugging face  

Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"


### Common Issue 2 - Missing Token Files 
Computer recognises localhost:5000/ not 127.0.0.1:5000/ or vise versa

Check assigned port number if it matches 5000. 
check from cmd
